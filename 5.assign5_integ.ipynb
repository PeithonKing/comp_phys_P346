    "&emsp;To find the center of mass of the beam with mass density $\\lambda(x) = x^2$.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Theory:\n",
    "&emsp;Let us use the fact that, if a body is pivoted at its center of mass, it will not rotate (net torque on it will be zero). So, we will try to find the net torque on the body if pivoted at a random position $a$. Then we will minimise the net torque (minimum value will be close to 0) to find the center of mass. This idea is inspired from the linear regression algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Method:\n",
    " - start at a random location on the beam (we have started with $a = 0$)\n",
    " - find torque on the beam if pivoted at that location (point $a$)\n",
    " - change the value of $a$ depending on the torque (if torque is positive, move a to the right, if negative, move a to the left. Also the distance by which we move $a$ is proportional (proportionality constant is $\\alpha$) to the torque)\n",
    " - with every step, we will reach a point where the torque will be lesser and lesser. Thus we will keep on taking smaller and smaller steps until we reach a point where the torque is almost zero. This point will be the center of mass of the beam. (**Note:** If we take a large value of $\\alpha$, the algorithm may not converge to the correct answer, rather it will diverge out. If we take a small value of $\\alpha$, the algorithm will take a lot of time to converge to the correct answer. So, we have to choose a value of $\\alpha$ such that the algorithm converges to the correct answer in a reasonable amount of time.)"
